## Table of Contents
1. [Introduction to GPU and CUDA Programming](https://github.com/SumayyahAli/Getting_Started_with_CUDA/tree/930b7e29cefd5bf739ca00d07109c8d4c59e55de/Introduction%20to%20CUDA%20and%20GPU%20Programming)
   

## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with C/C++ programming.
- A basic understanding of parallel computing concepts is helpful but not required.

## What's CUDA? and Why?
CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA. It allows developers to harness the power of NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate computing-intensive tasks. Whether you’re working on real-time data processing, image processing, scientific simulations, or deep learning, CUDA provides the tools to take advantage of GPU performance.

In this guide, we’ll cover the essentials of CUDA programming :)
